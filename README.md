# Video-Game-Analysis

For this project, I was given a dataset with information regarding video games and their sales from 1980 to 2016. The goal was to provide an analysis of the data that could be used to forecast sales and develop a marketing strategy for 2017. 

To view the project and my code, go to the Jupyter notebook file Sprint 5 Projest-3.ipynb. Here you will find a more in-depth description of the data and introduction to the project.
